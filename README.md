Hello, my name is Demetrio Jose Marruffo.
I am a Cybersecurity and Software student who lives in Victorville, California.
Looking forward to graduating from California State University San Bernardino with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a concentration in Cybersecurity. 
In my spare time, I complete my own research with various home labs and work on certificates to further my learning such as FreeCodeCamp.
